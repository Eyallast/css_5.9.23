  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: darkcyan;
  margin: 50px;
  position: relative;
  }

#inner {
width: 50px;

background: lightgreen;
position: absolute;
top: 10px;
}
  
  /* We have set the inner div with position absolute and gave it a
  top of 10px, but it is not working.
  Why?
  when setting the position to abs + adding top 10px, the little box will stay static to his 
  place and won't move, we can either play with the top to fix it (top 90px) or change the position.
#inner {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background: lightgreen;
  position: absolute;
  top: 90px;
  }
  1. explain in your own words what is the problem.
  2. fix the code using the positions weâ€™ve learned. 
  I had to add a position: relative; to the outter
